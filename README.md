## Election Audit Summary
This script can be used for any election, doesn't matter if it is for candidates and counties or two other items. You would be able to modifying the script where it says candidate and county. You can change these areas to any two new areas you would like as long as they are related. So you could use this for votes in a county fair related to the dessert contest. The first category could be the type of dessert such as cake, pie, muffins, or cupcake which could take place for the county in current code. Your favorite one in your said category such as the red velvet cake, German chocolate cake, carrot cake, or wedding cake could take place for the candidate.
